Skin tone app


I am doing an app with the purpose of helping users know what kind of skin tone they got. Users are supposed to login and do a simple test
to find out if their skin tone is warm or cool or maybe neutral (neutral is something extra).

Depending on what result the user get from the test a new view will appear with some information about the personal skin tone and what colors to
use in haircolors, clothes etcetera.
